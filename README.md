# AI Dice Predictor (Bayes' Theorem)
A Java GUI that guesses how many sides the die that you're rolling has.

Screenshots folder shows visualization of application.

The user chooses to roll either a 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 12-sided, or 20-sided die.
(This should be done with real dice, but alternatively, you can imagine rolling one and type in the result.
No cheating and changing your die until the program finishes.)
The program uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability of each possible die each time the user enters a result.
Once the program reaches a certain level of confidence about which die you chose, it lets you know its guess.
